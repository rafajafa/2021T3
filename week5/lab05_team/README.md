## Lab05 - Exercise - Team (1 point)

By yourself, answer the following questions:

1. What do you expect will end up being the biggest challenges of working in a team by the end of the term?
- Communication
- Time management(As a group)
- Delay from different members
- Fatigue toward the end of term and lead to bandwagon effect, so like when some member's attitude may become a little bit more tired and slow down, then other do follow that as that as well. 

2. Now that we're half way through, what is one aspect of teamwork that you're hoping to learn more about?
- May be a bit more communication especially in start up, talk abit more and give more detail about it.
